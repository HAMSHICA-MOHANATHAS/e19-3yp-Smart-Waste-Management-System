# SMART WASTE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM 

## Project Overview
Our project is a smart waste management system that aims to make the process of waste collection more efficient. The system utilizes waste bins and manages them through mobile and web applications. With the help of the system, users can easily check the status of the bins and follow a schedule for waste collection based on the bin's status. Our primary focus is on house owners, garbage collectors, and municipal authorities who serve as administrators in the system. The system is designed to make waste management easier and more effective for everyone involved.

## Project Components
- Hardware setup: Bins with level measuring sensors and temperature sensors, with proper power supply system connected to LEDs.
- Software setup: Mobile application for house owners and garbage collectors; Web application for municipal authorities.
- AWS Server: Hosting the website, data storing and database hosting.

## Key Features
- User-friendly web-based interface for administrators and mobile application for house owners and garbage collectors.
- Bin status monitoring.
- Auto-locking system while the wastage filled a certain level.
- Direct bin lock access to garbage collectors and administrators.

## Future Enhancements
We are eagerly planning to make it more automated using Machine Learning features, where the wastage collection is optimized according to the previous data series. 

##### We hope that this description will give a better view of our project.
